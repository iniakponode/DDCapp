# DDCapp
This is a telematic data tracking and monitoring App, first for the purpose of my PhD Reseaarch work on the use of an AI enabled Mobile app which is able to collect driving data, analyse them and provide a feedback for drivers in a way that encourages unsafe driving behaviours. @Damoov SDK is used as the base Engine.

How to Use
clone the project
update gradle files
clean and Build project
User is expected to generate a device token to be used to identify the device software is installed
User is requested to allow all permissions using the permission wizard that comes up automatically on click of the "Register Device" Button
On successful registeration of the device
User should click on the "Start Trip" button to enable the sdk and start a trip
Mobile device is enabled from step 11 to start tracking driving activities
"Start Trip" Button changes to "Stop Trip"
On click of "Stop Trip" the app disables the SDK and stops tracking driving data
At the moment, data is only stored in the app backend server, the project is still in progress, therefore, is in active development
